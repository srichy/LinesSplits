# LinesSplits

Convenience "splitting" functions for Swift (growing over time; this
is not "finished").  Basically, when I want some quick-and-dirty text
processing and don't want to have to deal with FileManager and
Data-to-String conversions and all that.

Oh, and if there's a built-in way to open a file and return a
line-by-line iterator, for example, please let me know.  I haven't
found it yet.
